            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am passionate developer with a focus on educational technology and AI-driven solutions. I have experience in web development, AI integration, and game design, particularly in creating tools that help teachers, students, and parents.<br><br>
                I have built websites using WordPress.org and am currently expanding my skills in manual coding to develop more customized and dynamic web solutions. My latest project, ARA (Automated Reporting App), streamlines special needs education reporting using AI, making documentation and assessments more efficient for educators. <br><br>
                I'm also studying Information Technology, majoring in Network Security, where I'm learning about cybersecurity, system administration, and network infrastructure. Additionally, I enjoy experimenting with game development using Godot, and I'm designing a programming-based educational platformer for kids. <br><br>
                Beyond coding, I have a strong interest in basketball, South Korean culture, and content creation. I'm also exploring YouTube as a way to share insights and tutorials related to technology and education. <br><br>
                Let's connect and create something impactful together! ðŸš€
