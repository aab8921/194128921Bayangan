            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>“Good morning, my name is John Doe, and I am a secondary education student at Western Michigan University with a focus in science. 
                I grew up in a family of teachers and know that being a high school science teacher is my calling. 
                My passion for helping others has been evident in my involvement in Kalamazoo Public Schools and as a camp counselor for the last three years. 
                Through those experiences I have learned to interact with a diverse group of people, which has increased my ability to relate to others. 
                I have also had the opportunity to create lessons for the campers that focused on life skills like teamwork, communication, and time management.  
                Having been a teacher yourself, what things should I be doing now to prepare for my internship search?”</p>
